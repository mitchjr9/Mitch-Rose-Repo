# Building the Future of Blockchain on Kadena

## Overview and Origin

### Name of company
Kadena

### When was the company incorporated?
2016 ("Roadmap")

### Who are the founders of the company?
Stuart Popejoy and Will Martino ("Roadmap")

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Kadena was created to revolutionize blockchain based on the network’s chainweb architecture. By leveraging a chainweb infrastructure, Kadena is attempting to achieve revolutionary speed, scale, and energy efficiency in blockchain.

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company is funded by private equity funds and banks and has received $15 million in capital fundraising. Kadena’s blockchain is powered by its native KDA token (Fries).


## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Kadena is trying to solve the problem of a layer 1 blockchain that can support a variety of applications with speed, security, and efficiency. While Ethereum was built with this goal in mind, because of its first mover advantage, it has become clogged, driving gas fees (transaction fees) upward. However, Ethereum can only process 15-45 transactions per second (tps) (“What's Ethereum 2.0, and What Does It Mean for ETH?”). Due to its chainweb infrastructure, Kadena can process 480,000 transactions per second on a 20-chain blockchain (“Why Kadena Matters"). Thus, Kadena’s innovative design enables it to process an incredibly high number of transactions per second, making it faster and cheaper to use its blockchain than competitors’ solutions.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Kadena markets to three groups of customers. First of all, Kadena wants to attract developers to its platform to build apps. With more people building applications on Kadena and more still using those applications, Kadena will earn more money based on those transactions. Additionally, Kadena markets to businesses to leverage Kadena as an enterprise solution. Finally, Kadena markets to cryptocurrency investors to purchase Kadena’s native token. This is important because investors can stake their Kadena to secure and provide liquidity to the network.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Kadena offers never-before-seen speed and efficiency for blockchain transactions on layer 1 protocols. With its blockchain scaled to 20 chains connected via Kadena’s chainweb design, Kadena can process 480,000 transactions per second. However, Kadena can scale infinitely via its chainweb infrastructure, so it can continue to be exceptionally fast and efficient even as traffic increases. Kadena’s key competitors are Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. While Ethereum can process 14-30 transactions per second, Solana operates at about 3,000 tps and can process up to 50,000 tps (iTrustCapital), and Avalanche runs at around 4,500 tps (“Avalanche"). Therefore, it’s clear Kadena offers revolutionary speed and efficiency as a layer 1 blockchain.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Kadena is currently using a variety of technologies. It leverages AWS and Microsoft Azure clouds to host its blockchain, and it built its own smart contract language, Pact, to engineer smart contracts to conduct transactions and build applications on Kadena (“Why Kadena Matters").

## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Kadena is in the cryptocurrency domain of finance. Kadena supports decentralized finance, NFTs, payments, lending, and cross-chain transfers. Thus, customers can conduct a variety of transactions on Kadena.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Cryptocurrency and blockchain have changed drastically over the last 5-10 years. Bitcoin was created in 2009, 12 years ago, and Ethereum was created in 2015, 6 years ago. These two blockchain platforms paved the way for others to follow and improve upon Bitcoin and Ethereum’s weaknesses. Once thought of as a ‘scam,’ ‘ponzi scheme,’ or strictly a manner of conducting black market transactions, cryptocurrencies and blockchains are finally being viewed as investments that could shape the future of our lives. With Facebook changing its name to Meta and pledging its commitment to the metaverse, Adidas partnering with The Sandbox to bring its brand to the metaverse, and venture capital funds buying millions of dollars in virtual land, along with Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to peak at nearly $70,000 per coin, it is clear that blockchain and cryptocurrencies are getting closer to mass adoption in 2021.

### What are the other major companies in this domain?
The other major companies in this domain are Ethereum, Solana Labs (Solana), and Ava Labs (Avalanche). These companies built competing layer 1 blockchains, and all of these platforms, among others, compete for developers to build on their platforms and investors to purchase their native tokens.


## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Kadena has a few notable partnerships but is still in the early stages of its launch. Kadena is partnered with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – developers and businesses can purchase Kadena’s solution on AWS and Azure Marketplace. Kadena also partnered with Coinmetro, a cryptocurrency exchange, to offer Kadena staking and enable transactions between Kadena and Ethereum. Finally, Kadena has also partnered with Terra, a stablecoin host, to enable transactions between Terra’s Luna stablecoin and Kadena’s native token. Kadena also hosts a variety of other projects, such as Colorblock (NFT marketplace), Marmalade (NFT marketplace launcher), Kaddex (exchange), Hypercent (dApp launchpad), Babena (NFT project), and DNA (Web3.0 product tracker), among others.

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
There are a few core metrics that companies in blockchain use to measure success. In terms of blockchain performance, key metrics include transactions per second, total transactions, and transaction cost. As previously mentioned, Kadena performs very well when compared to competitors, with its 480,000 transactions per second dwarfing those of Ethereum (15-45 tps), Avalanche (4,500 tps), and Solana (up to 50,000 tps). In terms of total transactions, Kadena ranks lower than its competition due to the infancy of the projects. Finally, in terms of transaction fees, Kadena performs very well when compared to Ethereum, which can sometimes require transaction fees that cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Kadena’s transaction fees are negligible due to its processing power. Also vital are the number of partnerships these layer 1 platforms have and how many/what projects are built on these platforms. One of the reasons Ethereum is so valuable is the projects built on the platform. Because there are a variety of commonly used projects built on Ethereum, such as Decentraland, OriginTrail, and Gala Games, among others, Ethereum is in more demand, and thus, is more valuable.

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Kadena is performing well based on the technicals of its solution, but it is lagging in terms of the projects built on the platform and use cases including the platform. For example, Avalanche recently partnered with Deloitte to help the consulting firm build a solution for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that improves the security, speed, and accuracy of disaster reimbursements. With Kadena’s connection to JP Morgan (Kadena is a JPM spinoff), the platform should leverage this connection to present itself as an enterprise solution for other major corporations. This, combined with other independent projects being built on Kadena, will drive users, investors, and transactions for the platform.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)
Kadena should build play-to-earn games on its blockchain. Blockchain play-to-earn games are becoming increasingly more popular as more people, especially gamers, get exposed to cryptocurrency. For example, Axie Infinity is a play-to-earn game built on Ethereum that has roughly 2.5 million monthly active users (xOOb). Thetan Arena, another play-to-earn game, has 6.6 million total players (“Thetan Arena"). Play-to-earn games present a valuable opportunity for Kadena because there are 2.7 billion people in the world that play video games (Gilbert), and when incentivized by being able to earn money while playing, people are further incentivized to play. Thus, Kadena should fund and develop play-to-earn games on its own platform.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Offering play-to-earn games would benefit Kadena for a variety of reasons. First of all, it would diversify the types of layer 2 projects built on Kadena and attract more users to the platform, which would drive utilization and increase awareness of Kadena. Introducing play-to-earn games would also benefit Kadena because it would attract new developers to build on Kadena, further increasing the potential for more people to use and invest in Kadena.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Play-to-earn games on Kadena would require many of the technologies already in use by Kadena. They would require AWS or Azure to host Kadena’s layer 1 blockchain on which the play-to-earn games would be built. These play-to-earn games would also require smart contracts, which are configurable on Kadena using the platform’s Pact language. The play-to-earn games would also likely leverage Kadena’s cross-chain payment capabilities between platforms such as Terra and Ethereum.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These technologies are appropriate for my solution because they are leveraging the tools that make Kadena the fastest layer 1 blockchain available. Kadena’s blockchain is already hosted in AWS and Azure clouds, and Kadena developed its Pact smart contract language to be more easily readable and programmable than other languages like Solidity. This makes it easier and more secure to build applications on Kadena, while also potentially increasing the pool of people that can build on Kadena with a language that’s easier to learn and understand. In order to build an application, a developer would also use Kadena’s information on GitHub and build using Pact in an IDE such as Atom.
